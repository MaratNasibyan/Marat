2.Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance - Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3.Abstract class is inherited (extends) -  Interface is implemented (implements).
4.Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface - Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
5.The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class - The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
6.Abstract class can have static methods, main method and constructor - Interface can't have static methods, main method or constructor.
7.It is necessary to implement(contract) all interface members, not in the abstract classes.
